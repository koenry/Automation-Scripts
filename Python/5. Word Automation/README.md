# Monthly Word report automation


### Grabs all Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri of a month saves its full date in one row.

### And in the second row of the table adds the performed work done this month.



#### The old.py was the first version which didnt work as intended so it was scrapped. I still left it around for some salvageable code ideas.
