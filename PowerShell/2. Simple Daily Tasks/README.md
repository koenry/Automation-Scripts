# Powerhsell daily task automation


#### Just a quick demo of what was/is used at work to automate some quick tasks. Creates word documents based on weekday, it checks if its monday-friday and creates the coresponding word document with todays date. 

####   Opens the needed websites where its going to be uploaded. Logins to the website, it stops and asks for an input after entering the username, I Dont like keeping passwords on plain text so id rather enter them myself same thing with VPN login it automates win key > types vpn > tabs so its selected and double enter to connect over using rasdial, W10 doesnt save rasdial info so rather than rasdial 'vpn'  you need to type in rasdial 'vpn' -user -password so its safer than keeping passwords on plain text.

#### Lastly  it macros outlook to the coresponding weekday and creates an email ready to be sent.


##### All of the links and private naming conventions were removed or changed for data security.






###### Quick note about the .bat its easier, without 3rd party modules, to make a powershell script double-clickable. You create a bat at the dir and then create a shortcut and place it for ex. on desktop, you dont need to change directories if its created with a shortcut at the same folder where the .ps1 script is
